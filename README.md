# Take Control of Your Digital Memory

OpenRecall is a fully open-source, privacy-first alternative to proprietary solutions like Microsoft's Windows Recall or Limitless' Rewind.ai. With OpenRecall, you can easily access your digital history, enhancing your memory and productivity without compromising your privacy.

## What does it do?

OpenRecall captures your digital history through regularly taken snapshots, which are essentially screenshots. The text and images within these screenshots are analyzed and made searchable, allowing you to quickly find specific information by typing relevant keywords into OpenRecall. You can also manually scroll back through your history to revisit past activities.

## Why Choose OpenRecall?

OpenRecall offers several key advantages over closed-source alternatives:

- **Transparency**: OpenRecall is 100% open-source, allowing you to audit the source code for potential backdoors or privacy-invading features.
- **Cross-platform Support**: OpenRecall works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, giving you the freedom to use it on your preferred operating system.
- **Privacy-focused**: Your data is stored locally on your device, no internet connection or cloud is required. In addition, you have the option to encrypt the data on a removable disk for added security, read how in our [guide](docs/encryption.md) here. 
- **Hardware Compatibility**: OpenRecall is designed to work with a [wide range of hardware](docs/hardware.md), unlike proprietary solutions that may require specific certified devices.
